// Server-rendered on every host so hooks.server.ts, not netlify.toml's static

// the Prismic Type Builder and Page Builder frame from another origin. While it
// was prerendered (the root layout's `prerender = "auto"`), Netlify served it as
// a static file with X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, so the Type Builder could not
// frame it. See $lib/security/cms-framing.ts.
