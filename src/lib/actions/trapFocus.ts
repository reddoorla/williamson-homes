// Focus management for modal overlays (WCAG 2.4.3 focus order + 2.1.2 no keyboard
// trap). Apply with `use:trapFocus` to an overlay element that is gated by an
// `{#if}` block, so the action's mount/destroy lifecycle matches open/close.
//
// On open it moves focus into the overlay; while open it cycles Tab/Shift+Tab
// within the overlay (so focus can't reach the now-inert page behind it); on
// close it restores focus to whatever was focused before — usually the control
// that opened the overlay.
//
// Listeners attach to `document`, not the overlay node: if focus ever escapes
// the overlay (e.g. a click on a non-focusable area drops focus on <body>), a
// node-scoped keydown listener would never see another keystroke and Tab would
// walk the page behind the overlay with no way back. From the document we still
// see every key, and a `focusin` listener pulls focus straight back into the
// overlay the moment it lands outside.
//
// Degenerate case: an overlay with no focusable children (e.g. an informational
// "rotate your device" modal) gets focus moved to the container but NO Tab trap
// and NO focusin recovery, because trapping with no focusable target and no
// Escape would itself be a keyboard trap (2.1.2). Pass `onEscape` for overlays
// that should close on Escape; omit it where the host component already handles
// Escape. Not for `<dialog>` opened via `showModal()` — the browser already
// provides all of this natively.
