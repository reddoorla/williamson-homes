/**
 * The palette a site sets in `app.css` has to be legible where the TEMPLATE
 * already spends it, and nothing checked that.
 *
 * What went wrong, on roalson-interests 2026-09-17: the brand's secondary
 * colour is a light warm grey, it was assigned to `--color-secondary`, and that
 * token is a TEXT role in eight places the site never touched — the footer
 * copyright, `Field.svelte`'s description, the eyebrows on LeadText,
 * TextColumns and Testimonial, the testimonial role line, the contact intro and
 * a dev fixture. So one token assignment failed axe on every page that renders
 * a footer, at 1.97:1. It was caught by the a11y gate, which is late: the gate
 * needs a built site and a browser, it names one node rather than the class,
 * and on a fresh clone it is pointed at fixtures and would not have run on a
 * real page at all.
 *
 * The naming is what makes this a trap. `--color-secondary` asserts that the
 * token is text-capable, and a brand's "secondary colour" very often is not.
 *
 * So this is a unit test, and it fails in milliseconds with no browser. It
 * encodes the pairs the template's own markup composes; a site that changes the
 * palette runs it unchanged and learns immediately.
