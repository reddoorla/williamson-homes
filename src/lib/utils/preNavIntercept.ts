 * - popstate: cancelling back/forward and re-issuing via `goto` would push a
 *   NEW history entry, trapping the user ahead of a growing stack — the back
 *   button must stay native.
 * - unloading navigations: cancel() there triggers the browser's
 *   "leave site?" dialog.
 * - external / unmatched URLs (no route id): full page load, nothing to fade.
 * - same-pathname navs (hash links, query-only changes): no page change to
 *   mask.
 * - our own deferred goto arriving at its target: intercepting again would
 *   loop forever.
