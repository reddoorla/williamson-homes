// The scroll reveal's hidden state has three halves that have to agree, and
// none of them is reachable from jsdom (which resolves no stylesheets and
// never parses app.html):
//
//   1. app.css hides `[data-reveal]` under `prefers-reduced-motion:
//      no-preference`, so server-rendered markup is hidden at FIRST PAINT
//      rather than yanked to opacity 0 at hydration.
//   2. app.html's <noscript> style forces it back, so a browser that will
//      never run the reveal is never shown less than a crawler gets.
//   3. animateIn's inline write has to be byte-identical to (1), or hydration
//      is a visible state change instead of the no-op it is meant to be.
//
// Resolved from the project root, not `import.meta.url`: under the jsdom
// environment vite serves this module over http, so `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`
// is not a file: URL and readFileSync rejects it.
