// The 3-strike rule, made countable.
//
//   node matching/strikes.mjs [page]
//
// The matching skill says: "A region that has not improved after 3 fix ->
// re-run cycles: stop. Present the three attempts. Do not widen the threshold,
// mask it, or reclassify it — a stuck region means your model of it is wrong."
//
// That rule was blown twice on this project (services `top`, yfv `top`) purely
// because nobody was counting. This reads every matching/out-*/report.json,
// reconstructs each region's history in chronological order, and prints the
// regions that are OUT OF STRIKES. Exit 1 when any exist, so a round that
// starts by running this cannot quietly attempt a fourth cycle.
//
// WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEASURES (read before trusting a number): report.json
// cannot record INTENT, so a "cycle" here is any completed gate run in which
// the region was still failing and did not improve by IMPROVE_PP. Runs aimed at
// a different region on the same page therefore count too. That makes this a
// STALL detector, not a literal attempt counter — "this has been failing,
// unchanged, across N gate runs while you were working on this page." That is
// the more useful discipline number anyway, and it is honest about being an
// upper bound. Improvement resets the count: real progress earns a fresh start.
