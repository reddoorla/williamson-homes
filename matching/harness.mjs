// The single source for everything the matching gates need to know about this
// site. DATA lives in matching/harness.json (site-edited); this file is the

// the `reddoor-maint match-harness` recipe, which owns these bytes: a hand
// edit here is flagged on the next run and never silently overwritten.)
//
// It exists because the page table, the two hosts, the matrix, the threshold
// and the skill path were hand-copied all over matching/. Re-measured
// 2026-09-09 AFTER the six-probe conversion, over the 216 tracked scripts under
// matching/ (214 top-level — 212 .mjs + 2 .sh — plus 2 in states/):
//
//   • a hand-typed copy of the page table (three or more gate keys sitting next
//     to their route): 8 files. Exactly ONE of them, probe-chrome-count.mjs,
//     still carries all nine rows; probe-anchors.mjs carries five; the other
//     six are three-row detail triples (team/svc/qa).
//   • the skill path (~/.claude/skills/matching-a-page): 193 copies
//   • the viewport matrix (1440/834/390): 51 copies
//   • REF pointed at a host listed in selfHosts — i.e. comparing the candidate
//     with itself: 12 scripts, one of which (probe-chrome-count.mjs) is also
//     the last nine-row table carrier
//
// The first bullet read "the nine-row page table: 5 copies — gate.sh,
// probe-anchor-parity.mjs, sweep-all10.sh, sweep-all16.sh, sweep-final.sh" when
// it was written here at 922dde3. It was wrong within the hour and wrong on two
// counts: 4e2cd7b took the table out of gate.sh, and the list never named
// states/index.mjs or probe-chrome-count.mjs, which were both carrying nine-row
// copies at the time. A census is a claim about code; it has to be measured
// against the tree, not recalled.
