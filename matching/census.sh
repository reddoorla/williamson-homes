# style-census diffs the computed type tuple (family, weight, size,
# line-height, letter-spacing, transform, colour) of every text snippet present
# on BOTH pages. It is the only gate that catches the 11px footer line and the
# cyan-vs-teal link that page-diff is structurally blind to — a region can be
# pixel-clean at 0.10 and still be wearing the wrong colour on small text.
#
# Prints a per-page/per-viewport mismatch count and leaves the full runs in
# matching/census-<page>-<vw>.log. Exits 1 while any count is non-zero, and 2
# when it cannot honestly report a count at all.
#
# EVIDENCE — read before adding a guard here, or removing one. A green here
# has to be produced by a census that RAN. It was not: with style-census.mjs
# absent this gate printed "Phase 3 CLEAN — 0 undeclared type mismatches" and
# exited 0. Every run died on module resolution, census-count.mjs read each
# crash log as "0 0 0" (it counts `  y=` rows and a stack trace has none —
# census-count.mjs:35-56), and no rows was reported as no mismatches. Measured
# again with style-census.mjs PRESENT and the candidate host down: identical
# output, because style-census exits 1 both when it finds mismatches
# (style-census.mjs:187) and when it dies before it looks — so the exit status
# cannot tell a finding from a crash and may not grant a green either.
#
# The guards below are what next.mjs:83-89 (no parseable gate run — refusing to
# report a score), strikes.mjs:87-97 (refusing to report "clear") and
# gate.sh:37-42 (preflight page-diff before spending a run) already do. Each
# demands an artefact only a working census produces; none of them can turn a
# red green.
