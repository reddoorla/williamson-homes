# The matching gate. This file is generic — everything specific to a site lives
# in matching/harness.json (the data) and matching/LEDGER.md (the why). It is
# installed and upgraded by the `reddoor-maint match-harness` recipe, which
# owns these bytes: a hand edit here is flagged on the next run, never
# silently overwritten.
#
#   bash matching/gate.sh <round-tag> [page ...]
#
# Runs page-diff for every page in the table (or just the named ones) at the
# full breakpoint matrix and writes matching/out-<round-tag>-<page>/.
#
# The matrix, the anchor lists, the reference and the candidate are DATA. Why a
# site chose them — which live breakpoint band hid what, why an anchor is a
# heading and not a button label — belongs in matching/LEDGER.md, which is dated
# and append-only, because JSON holds no comments.
#
# NO MASKS and the threshold from harness.json everywhere: the numbers stay
# honest and a known floor stays visible as its own region. A media-neutralised
# secondary read is `node "$PD" ... --neutralize-media`; next.mjs ignores such
# runs on purpose (next.mjs:57-64).
#
# PREFLIGHT (see the matching rules in CLAUDE.md): a page with no section in
# matching/SPEC.md has not had Phase 1 done, and its geometry must not be
# touched. Skipping the spec is how a reference's root-font ladder and its
# per-component height ladders get found reactively, after the region has
# already failed several rounds. This refuses the run instead of trusting anyone
# to remember.
