# Accessibility

This starter targets **WCAG 2.2 Level AA**. Accessibility is treated as a default, not a phase — every component ships accessible-by-default and every PR is gated against regressions.

## What's wired by default

- **Skip-to-main-content link** on every page ([+layout.svelte](../src/routes/+layout.svelte)).
- **Focus-managed `<main>`** with `tabindex="-1"` so route changes can move focus into content.
- **Accessible primitives** for the patterns most likely to ship a11y bugs:
  - [Accordion](../src/lib/components/Accordion.svelte) — disclosure pattern with `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`.
  - [Modal](../src/lib/components/Modal.svelte) — native `<dialog>` with backdrop, ESC-to-close, and implicit focus trap.
  - [Nav](../src/lib/components/Nav.svelte) — the menu trigger and the overlay's Close both carry `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls` pointing at the overlay's id, so the menu's state is announced across the swap that unmounts one control and mounts the other. Both acknowledge a press on touch via `data-pressed`: CSS `:active` does not fire for a touch press, so a tap that looks like nothing happened gets repeated.
  - [Slider](../src/lib/components/Slider.svelte) — `aria-roledescription="carousel"`, per-slide controls with `aria-current`.
  - [Form / Field](../src/lib/components/Form.svelte) — every input has a programmatic label, required fields announce "(required)" to screen readers, errors link via `aria-describedby` and surface in a focused error summary.
- **A keyboard-focus floor** — every link, button, `<summary>` and tabbable element gets a 2px `:focus-visible` outline from [app.css](../src/app.css), so a component that ships no ring of its own is still keyboard-navigable (WCAG 2.4.7). Authored `focus-visible:ring-*` utilities still win: the floor is written with `:where()`, which contributes zero specificity.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` honored** in animation primitives ([animateIn.ts](../src/lib/actions/animateIn.ts)) — users with the OS preference get no transform, no transition, immediate reveal. The preference is watched rather than sampled once, so turning it on mid-session stops the reveals where the reader is instead of on their next page load.
- **No content depends on JavaScript to become visible.** The scroll reveal's hidden state ships in the markup for above-fold elements (`data-reveal`), which is what stops content painting and then vanishing at hydration — but a hidden element that JS never un-hides would be worse than the flash. A `<noscript>` style in [app.html](../src/app.html) releases it for scripting-off browsers, and every server-hidden element carries `animateIn`'s `failSafe` timer for the cases where scripting is on but the reveal cannot run (no `IntersectionObserver`, a throttled background tab). Measured with scripting on and off in [tests/interaction/reveal-no-js.spec.ts](../tests/interaction/reveal-no-js.spec.ts).
- **Compiler-level a11y warnings** via Svelte's built-in checks (run on `pnpm lint`).

Run locally:

```bash
pnpm verify           # everything CI runs, in CI's order
pnpm test:unit        # vitest unit tests
pnpm test:smoke       # Playwright + axe (boots vite dev)
pnpm test:a11y        # the fleet a11y audit CI gates on
pnpm dlx @lhci/cli autorun   # Lighthouse against lighthouserc.json — manual, not in CI
```

## Manual testing reference

Automated tooling (axe, the fleet a11y audit, the Svelte compiler) catches the bulk of WCAG violations on every code change. Manual passes aren't part of the standard build. If a client reports an issue or an external audit identifies a gap, these are the checks worth running to reproduce and confirm fixes:

- Keyboard-only navigation through every interactive element, including tab order, visible focus rings, and trap-free modals
- Screen reader pass with VoiceOver (macOS / iOS) and NVDA (Windows / Firefox)
- 200% browser zoom — no clipped content or horizontal scroll
- Windows High Contrast mode — borders, focus rings, and form errors remain visible
- Reduced-motion OS setting — no animation plays
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 on body text, 3:1 on UI components and large text

## Adding new accessible components

1. **Start from a native element** when one exists (`<button>`, `<dialog>`, `<details>`). Re-implementing them in `<div>`s is the #1 source of a11y bugs.
2. **Add the component to `/dev/a11y-fixtures`** so the axe gate covers it.
3. **Pair label + input** with `for`/`id` on every form control (Field handles this).
4. **Don't trap focus accidentally** — only modals/popovers should trap. Everything else should let Tab continue out.
5. **Mark errors with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"`** so screen readers announce them when they appear.

## Accessibility statement

Public-sector and education clients should publish an accessibility statement at `/accessibility`, naming the conformance target (WCAG 2.2 AA), known gaps, and a contact route for reporting barriers. No template ships here — write it against the site's actual audit results, since a statement that overclaims is worse than none.

## Reporting issues

Treat accessibility regressions as P1 bugs. They block merges to `main`.
