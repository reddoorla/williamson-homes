# CLAUDE.md

Session rules for AI agents working a Reddoor site repo. This file ships with
the template, so every site generated from it starts with these rules.

## Before you push

```bash
pnpm verify
```

That is exactly what CI runs, in CI's order (prettier → eslint → svelte-check →
build → axe audit → unit + smoke). Run it instead of guessing which subset
matters — a red CI on a site repo costs a round trip through review.

Formatting is enforced on `.svelte` files too: the plugin loads from
`.prettierrc`, not from a CLI flag. Don't reintroduce `--plugin` to the `lint`
script — with no config file, `prettier --check .` silently skips every
`.svelte` file, and that is exactly the hole the config closes.

## Concurrent sessions

Site repos generally get **one** agent session at a time — but central
fleet-maintenance sessions (reddoor-maintenance) also open PRs here, so:

- **Check for an existing fix before starting one.** Look for fresh `fix/*`
  branches and open or just-merged PRs addressing the same signal — a fleet
  session may already have been dispatched for it. A duplicate fix gets
  closed as superseded, never merged.
- **Re-verify after any pause.** After a session-limit pause, compaction, or
  long gap: `git log --oneline -3` and `git status` before committing, and
  re-confirm the PR head SHA before merging.
- **If sessions must run concurrently** (rare), each works in its own git
  worktree — never commit from a checkout another session may be using.
- **Check a PR's real changed-file list before merging.** Fleet branches can be
  stacked on another open PR and drag it onto main.

## The work journal

**Every working session appends a dated entry to `docs/workJournal.md`** — what
was done and **why**, newest at the bottom, never corrected in place. Write it
as the last act of the session, not the first act of the next one.

The journal is the history of executing the build. Code says what the system
does now; the journal says what it used to do, what it cost to change, and
which beliefs turned out to be wrong. Nearly everything expensive to rediscover
lives there and nowhere else.

An entry is headed with the date, a short title, and where it landed:

```markdown
## 2026-09-04 — Both runway stages render their final frame without JS (#51, `ce46ae0`)
```

Then prose — not a bullet list of file names, which the diff already tells you.
What to put in, in rough order of value:

- **Why, over what.** The reason a thing was done survives; the diff does not
  need restating.
- **Measured numbers, exactly.** "The comp's open mask is 2696×2352 on an 860px
  band — 2.735× the band's height, so a 390×664 phone needs ~534%" is worth
  keeping. "Fixed the hero on mobile" is not.
- **Defects, named.** What broke, what it looked like, and what made it
  invisible until it wasn't.
- **What was tried and abandoned**, and what it would take to revive it. A dead
  end nobody wrote down gets walked twice.
- **Beliefs corrected on contact.** The design assumption that turned out false
  is usually the most valuable line in the entry.
- **Honest accounting.** If a win came from somewhere other than the change
  that claimed it, say so — that is exactly what someone will otherwise
  over-invest in next.

**History is never edited to be right.** An entry that stops being true is not
rewritten; a later entry corrects it, and says which one it corrects. The
journal is a record of what was believed at the time, and that record is most
useful precisely where it was wrong. Fixing the past in place destroys the only
evidence of how the mistake was made.

The one edit an old entry may take is a **forward pointer**: one line directly
under its heading naming the entry that overturned it — `> Superseded in part by
2026-10-14 — <that entry's title>.` It asserts nothing new and retracts nothing,
so the record of what was believed survives whole; it only stops a reader who
lands on the old paragraph from leaving with the old answer. Without it the rule
above is half a mechanism: the correction exists at the bottom of the file, and
nothing points to it from where a reader actually arrives.

If a session produced nothing worth an entry, that is itself worth one line.

## Six rules that came from shipping a site

Each of these is a defect class that shipped on a real build, not a preference.
They are stated as rules because in every case the reasoning was available at the
time and did not get applied.

### A pass needs positive evidence — never the absence of an error

The single most expensive pattern. A green must require an artifact only a
working system produces: a 2xx for the script that makes the widget, a minted
token, a real submission traced end to end. **An error matcher may only ever DENY
a green**, never grant one.

Worked example, because the shape is slippery. A site's `/health` reported
`turnstile: true` — a truthiness check on an env var that never contacts
Cloudflare — and that boolean was allowed to mean "the widget works". The fix
required a mount point in the DOM, which the component server-renders whenever
the env var is set. The next fix required Cloudflare's script to load, which it
does regardless of whether the sitekey is valid. Each correction reintroduced the
same shape one step along, and the last survived by exactly one error code.

Corollary: **a field that can only observe configuration must never be named
after the thing it cannot observe.**

### Enumerate the defect class before fixing an instance

When a defect is found, the next question is _what else is in this class_ —
every value a script supplies, every string the CMS does not write, every
`%sveltekit.*%` placeholder — then fix once. Fixing instances one at a time
shipped four PRs for no-JS (three of them inside 69 minutes, each merged
believing it had closed the class), four for a second locale, and the same
template-placeholder bug twice in one hour, the second time in the act of
documenting the first.

### A claim about what the tests cover is a claim about code

So it must be made by reading that code. Three claims about a probe's behaviour
were written and found false within 24 hours, including one asserting it swapped
a sitekey when nothing in it wrote `data-sitekey` at all. **Documentation written
in the same session as the fix is a hypothesis, not a record.**

Two things follow:

- **Write the test that fails for the reason you think it fails, by breaking the
  thing on purpose.** A guard that names a class in its selector passes a rename
  happily — the class stops matching, so the test measures one element and finds
  one. Mutate, watch it go red, then keep it.
- **Check what the shared harness forces.** `playwright-a11y` sets
  `contextOptions.reducedMotion: "reduce"` on every test, which made a whole
  class of new no-JS tests vacuous while they passed.

### Read the inventory before writing behaviour

`docs/COMPONENTS.md` is generated from `src/lib` and lists every shared module
with its real prop/export names and test count. Read it before writing
interactive behaviour into a slice — a carousel, a dialog, a disclosure, a focus
trap, a reduced-motion check.

This is not "check for existing work" restated. That instruction was already in
this file and did not stop three re-derivations in two days on one site:
`Slider.svelte` rebuilt as a slice-local carousel, `actions/trapFocus.ts` as six
hand-rolled dialogs, and `transitions.ts`'s `prefersReducedMotion` copied
verbatim into two slices. Every session had read CLAUDE.md. The instruction was
never the missing piece — the DATA was. Nothing anywhere put the string
`Slider.svelte` next to the word "carousel".

So it is a list, not a gate, and deliberately so. A check that fails in CI fires
after the component is written: the hour is already spent and all it saves is
the merge. It has to be read before the decision or it does nothing.

**Reuse is not always the answer.** A component whose markup fights the design is
a reason to lift its logic, not to reach for it whole — and on a site with a
matching harness, the geometry gate diffs slice DOM against transcribed reference
markup, so a shared component often cannot be dropped in at all. That is an
argument against reusing the component and never against reading it. Where you
decline one, say which and why: in `matching/LEDGER.md` on a matching site, in
the journal otherwise.

**Regenerate** with `node scripts/capability-index.mjs` after adding or changing
anything under `src/lib`. `scripts/capability-index.test.ts` fails when the index
is stale — that guard is retroactive on purpose, because it protects the index
rather than the decision.

**Optional, and the part that fires first.** `scripts/hooks/reuse-context.mjs` is
a `UserPromptSubmit` hook: given a request naming behaviour this repo ships, it
prints the matching rows before the agent plans. It never blocks a tool call —
one false refusal makes the whole mechanism something to route around. Enable it
with a `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/scripts/hooks/reuse-context.mjs\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`.claude/` is gitignored here and machine-wide on at least one maintainer's
setup, so that file is per-checkout until someone decides otherwise.

### Anything found and not fixed in the same PR gets an issue

A code comment is not a tracker and a doc correction is not a fix. The a11y gate
gap was correctly diagnosed and written up as a documentation correction; the
real fix was eight strings in `package.json` and waited two more days. A note
about unlicensed placeholder photography lived in a code comment for four days
and became the largest launch blocker, because it was in neither an issue nor
the "what is NOT done" list — the two places a launch sweep reads.

### Verify on a production build

Some defects are not merely invisible on the dev server — it **actively hides**
them. Both scroll-driven runway stages rendered correctly under `vite dev` and
frame 0 in the shipped bundle. Fonts load by a different CSP directive in dev
than in prod, so a CSP assertion exercised against `pnpm dev` proves nothing
about the shipped path. `pnpm build && pnpm preview` before believing a
CSP, font, hydration or no-JS result.

### Branch per batch, and keep in-flight state where it survives the session

Two deterministic losses, neither a judgment call: a PR squash-merged while
commits were still landing on its branch orphaned them silently, with no CI and
nothing on main; and a PR stacked on another PR's branch was auto-closed when
that base was deleted, and **a closed PR whose base is gone cannot be reopened**.

Branch each batch off `main`. And when work is in flight across a pause — a
session limit, a compaction, a crash — the journal entry is what survives it.

## Traps

- **`src/lib/slices/index.ts` and `prismicio-types.d.ts` are generated** by
  the Prismic CLI (`pnpm prismic:gen`; Slice Machine is gone, deprecated by
  Prismic 2026-09-18). Edit a model's JSON, regenerate, commit both; the
  `prismic-codegen` job fails a PR whose generated files are stale. Run by an
  agent, the CLI refuses without `--task-id` and `--user-intent` (analytics
  only), and `pnpm prismic:gen` cannot pass them to both commands, so an agent
  runs the two itself: `pnpm exec prismic task-id` once, then
  `pnpm exec prismic gen types --task-id <id> --user-intent "<the ask>"` and
  the same for `gen slice-index`. Never `prismic push` or `prismic pull`: both
  delete to match, and `pull` removes whole slice directories, components
  included. Curated `mocks.json` content is not touched by either `gen`
  command.
- **The `your-prismic-repo-name` sentinel is load-bearing.** It keeps a
  clone's build green before the CMS exists. See docs/NEW-SITE.md.
- **`RepositoryNotFoundError` extends `NotFoundError`.** Catching `NotFoundError`
  to serve a 404 will silently swallow a misconfigured repository name.
- **Never hand-roll `scrollTo`** — use `$lib/utils/instantNavScroll`.
- **Never redraw an asset in CSS** when the real file is downloadable. Ship the
  file.

## Matching rules (installed by reddoor-maint match-harness)

The `matching-a-page` skill governs a live-reference rebuild. These five rules
exist because the skill alone did not hold on the project this harness came
from — each one is a drift that actually happened, with the mechanical check
that now catches it. `matching/harness.json` is this site's configuration;
`matching/LEDGER.md` is the dated record of every deviation, floor and mask.

### 1. Source prescribes, rects only verify

Every geometry fix must cite the rule it came from: a line in the captured
reference stylesheet under `matching/spec/`, or the reference's HTML. "The probe
says the gap is 40px" is not a source. If you cannot name the line you are
guessing — go read the stylesheet first.

**Check:** the commit body must name the file:line for each fix.
**Operator's challenge:** _"which line of the reference stylesheet says that?"_

### 2. Phase 1 before Phase 4

A page gets its section census and per-section spec in `matching/SPEC.md` BEFORE
its geometry is touched. No SPEC section, no geometry round. The census is the
coverage denominator; skipping it is how a reference's root-font ladder and its
per-component height ladders get discovered reactively, after the region has
already failed several rounds.

**Check:** `matching/gate.sh` refuses to run a page with no `SPEC.md` section.
**Operator's challenge:** _"show me the SPEC section for that region."_

### 3. Three strikes, then stop

A failing region that has not improved across 3+ gate runs does not get a fourth
attempt. Present the attempts. Never widen the threshold, add a mask, or
reclassify it as a floor to make it go away.

**Check:** `node matching/strikes.mjs <page>` — exits 1 while any region is
stalled, and is the first thing a geometry round runs.
**Operator's challenge:** _"how many runs has that region been flat?"_

### 4. A gate closes an item, nothing else

No fix is "done" because the code changed. Paste the gate header — it is
self-describing, so a nonstandard threshold or an undisclosed mask is visible.
The threshold and the matrix are whatever `matching/harness.json` says, on every
page, never a subset.

**Check:** `bash matching/census.sh <page>` exits 0 — the Phase 3 style gate,
and the only one that sees an 11px footer line or a cyan-vs-teal link the pixel
diff is structurally blind to. A remaining row is fixed at its source or
declared in `matching/census-deviations.mjs` with a LEDGER line, never ignored.
**Operator's challenge:** _"paste the gate header."_

### 5. A commit is a checkpoint, not a stopping point

Do not hand control back between rounds. After committing, run
`node matching/next.mjs`: while it exits 1 there is a named next action, and the
round continues. Report when the backlog is empty, when a decision is genuinely
the operator's (three strikes, a novel floor, a threshold change), or when
asked — not because a commit felt like a natural place to summarise.

This exists because the failure was habitual, not deliberate: a turn ends when
user-facing prose gets written, and "I just committed something good" is the
moment that invites writing it. The gate stops incorrect work; this stops
premature stopping.

**Pausing:** create `matching/PAUSED` holding a note that says what the pause
means; `next.mjs` and `strikes.mjs` then exit 0 while it exists. This rule says
"do not stop while work is named"; it never said "find work to name". An empty
agenda and a paused one end the round the same way. Deleting the switch is the
operator's call.

**Check:** `node matching/next.mjs` — exits 1 while any non-floor region fails.
**Operator's challenge:** _"what does next.mjs say?"_

### Round protocol

1. `node matching/strikes.mjs <page>` — if it exits 1, the stalled regions are
   the agenda, and stalled ones get escalated rather than re-attempted.
2. Confirm the page has a `matching/SPEC.md` section; write
   `matching/spec-sections/<page>.md` and run `node matching/build-spec.mjs` if
   not.
3. Fix, each change citing its source line.
4. `bash matching/gate.sh <tag> <page>` — paste the header.
5. `bash matching/census.sh <page>` — exits 0 or the round is not closed; a
   remaining row is fixed at its source or declared with a LEDGER line.
6. Append to `matching/LEDGER.md` at the moment a deviation, floor or mask is
   decided, not reconstructed at the end.
7. `pnpm verify`, then commit and push.
