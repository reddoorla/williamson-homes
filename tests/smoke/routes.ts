// Committed per-site smoke manifest. `tests/smoke/pages.spec.ts` iterates this
// list, asserting each route returns its expected status and paints a hydration
// marker with no console errors. This ships the SAFE DEFAULT every reddoor-starter
// clone inherits; each site's figma-slices build grows the list as real routes
// land (add `{ path, name, hydrationMarker }` entries).
//
// NOTE on the default `/` entry: on the bare placeholder starter, `/`
// intentionally 404s (getByUID("page","home") can't resolve against the
// placeholder repo → error(404)), so the entry below gates its expectation on
// the repository name — mirroring `isPlaceholderRepo` in src/lib/prismicio.ts
// and the entries() prerender guard in the home route. The moment a fork wires
// a real Prismic repo in prismic.config.json, the same entry expects 200
// with zero edits. The hydration marker `footer` is the shared layout footer,
// present on every page including the error page.

// Playwright runs this file as native ESM in Node, where JSON imports require
// the explicit attribute (unlike Vite-bundled src/lib/prismicio.ts).
